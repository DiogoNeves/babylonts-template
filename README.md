# Babylon TS Template

> A template for creating Babylon TS projects.

A simple implementation Babylon scene, setup using TypeScript.

## Getting Started

1. Look inside the `package.json` and make sure all urls make sense and you're happy with the options.  
1. Run `npm install`.  

`./public/index.html` defines the html template used (no changes required for now).  
Look at `./src/app.ts` to start coding.
