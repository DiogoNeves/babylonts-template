# Babylon TS Template

> A template for creating Babylon TS projects.

A simple implementation Babylon scene, setup using TypeScript.

## Using

Look inside the `package.json` and make sure all urls make sense and you're happy with the options.  
Run `npm install`.  

`npm run dev`: Runs the webpack local server.  
`npm run build`: Builds the application into the `dist` folder.  
`npm test`: Runs the `jest` tests.  

`./public/index.html` defines the html template used.  
Look at `./src/app.ts` to get coding.
